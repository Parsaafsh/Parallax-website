          <p class="scroll2" data-rate="2">
            Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and
            directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived
            in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it,
            with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum
            known as spacetime.The concept of space is considered to be of
            fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe.
            However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it
            is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a
            conceptual framework. Debates concerning the nature, essence and the
            mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to
            treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections
            on what the Greeks called khôra , or in the Physics of Aristotle in
            the definition of topos, or in the later "geometrical conception of
            place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place of the
            11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen. Many of these classical
            philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then
            reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early
            development of classical mechanics. In Isaac Newton's view, space
            was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and
            independently of whether there was any matter in the space. Other
            natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead
            that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects,
            given by their distance and direction from one another. In the 18th
            century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to
            refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New
            Theory of Vision. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that
            the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from
            experiences of the outside world - they are elements of an already
            given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure
            all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his
            Critique of Pure Reason as being a subjective "pure a priori form of
            intuition". In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to
            examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is
            conceived as curved, rather than flat. According to Albert
            Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational
            fields deviates from Euclidean space.Experimental tests of general
            relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a
            better model for the shape of space.

            The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude
            of 254 kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the lunar
            surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking the record
            for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970. As of
            26 November 2022 Voyager 1 was at a distance of 159 AU (23.8 billion
            km; 14.8 billion mi) from Earth. It is the most distant human-made

            lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated
            around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet
            space program and it opened an entirely new era in space
            exploration: human spaceflight.
